# moneythrower-standalone

Adds the very well balanced Moneythrower from Payday's 8th anniversary as a permanent addition.

* Reactivates the 'collect 2 statues' sidejob, must be completed to unlock the weapon
* Is NOT a dlc unlocker, this weapon is *not* the same as the actual moneythrower, however is functionally identical
* Pretty sure it does not deduct offshore cash, will investigate at request

**important**

This mod acts like a custom weapon and as such will likely not sync properly to peers. I dont have friends so I cannot test this. This also prevents the potential of marking you as a cheater if you just unlocked the other one
