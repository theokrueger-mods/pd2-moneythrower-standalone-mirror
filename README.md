# moneythrower-standalone

Adds the very well balanced Moneythrower from Payday's 8th anniversary as a permanent addition.

Reactivates the 'collect 2 statues' sidejob, must be completed to unlock the weapon.

**important**
* this is a completely standalone addition of the moneythrower as the files for it were removed from the game un update 210
* peers will see you holding a standard flamethrower
* REQUIRES you to complete the sidejob to unlock
